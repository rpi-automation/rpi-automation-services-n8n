* `[n8n]export_workflows_as_json.json` - this is saving all not archived workflows into separate files
* `[n8n][old]export_workflows_as_json_old_sh_version.json` - old version of above - it was using bash commands instaed of api call so it ws executing much longer 
* `[n8n]get_current_credentials.json` - allows to see all current unencrypted credentias stored in n8n

synchronising workflows will be done by n8n, for now it's made manually so repo is not empty
