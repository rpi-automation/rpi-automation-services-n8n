# rpi-automation-services-n8n
n8n automation configs for services running on raspberry pi

[n8n]export_workflows_as_json.json - this is saving all not archived workflows into separate files
[n8n][old]export_workflows_as_json_old_sh_version - old version of above - it was using bash commands instaed of api call so it ws executing much longer 

synchronising workflows will be done by n8n, for now it's made manually so repo is not empty
